Random User Generator

Create a new React app and push the repo to github, then checkout to a new branch and continue working on new branch
The endpoint information and docs can be found at https://randomuser.me/documentation
The app should list random users acquired from get request to https://randomuser.me/api/?results=50

Create a page users/:id where you can list all the data for selected user.. Since you canâ€™t get a user by id from endpoint, save the clicked user data in local storage before navigating.
Optionally create a gender filter by adding a query parameter to the endpoint https://randomuser.me/api/?gender=female
